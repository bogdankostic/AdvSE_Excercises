# MLOps

## 1. What are the key principles of ml-ops?
Machine Learning Model Operationalization Management (MLOps) covers the entire lifecycle from data acquisition to 
monitoring the final data product. It involves managing the complete process from data acquisition to user-oriented 
optimization of an ML product. The three main components are data acquisition and preparation, model training and 
production, and model integration.
Data acquisition and preparation involve collecting and preparing data for model training. Model training and production
focus on developing and producing the machine learning model. Model integration incorporates the trained model into the 
final data product.

## 2. What is model governance in the context of ml-ops and what would be the key points if you explain this to a CEO?
Model governance ensures that machine learning products are developed within legal and practical boundaries. 
It involves considering legal restrictions, data protection, product safety, customer security, and IT security from 
the start. Risk management is crucial, assessing risks at every stage of development. Legal and ethical compliance 
ensures adherence to laws and ethical standards. Continuous monitoring regularly updates and reviews the product to 
manage ongoing risks. Explaining to a CEO, model governance is about embedding risk management into every phase of 
the product lifecycle, ensuring the product is safe, compliant, and reliable.

## 3. As we had a CI/CD lecture: what is the connection between ml-ops and CI/CD?!
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are crucial in MLOps. They ensure that ML products are 
constantly improving and evolving. Continuous Integration (CI) involves testing all parts of the product, from data 
input to the final model output. Continuous Delivery (CD) focuses on continuously learning and optimizing the model 
using new data, often automated to reduce human intervention. These practices ensure that ML products remain 
effective and up-to-date.

## 4. Describe the MLOps infrastructure stack in two paragraphs!
The MLOps infrastructure involves two key stages: ideation and operation. During the ideation and build stage, an ML 
product is conceptualized and a prototype is created. This phase focuses on optimizing and automating the entire 
lifecycle from data collection to model deployment. The goal is to ensure the infrastructure can support continuous 
operation and improvement, recognizing that software and ML products are never fully complete. This includes designing 
systems that handle data acquisition, model training, and integration seamlessly, allowing for ongoing updates and 
refinements.

In the create and operate stage, the ML product is developed and managed as a service. This involves continuous 
iteration and enhancement as both the product and its environment evolve. Resources are processed into the ML model, 
which is then deployed and monitored to ensure optimal performance. Continuous support and maintenance are crucial, 
as they generate data that can be used to improve the product further. This cyclical process of evaluation and 
enhancement ensures that the ML product remains effective and up-to-date, adapting to new data and requirements over 
time.
