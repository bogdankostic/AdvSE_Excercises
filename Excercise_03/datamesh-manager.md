# Data Mesh Manager Demo Analysis

The Data Mesh Manager improves data management by connecting data owners and consumers. 
It organizes data sources (e.g., databases) and data products (processing and outcomes). 
This is an analysis of the demo environment of the Data Mesh Manager website.

The demo simulates an e-commerce scenario, illustrating the flow from data sources to products and their consumers. 
The interactive dashboard shows various processes in the data management lifecycle.

### Interactive Data Map

The demo's main feature is an interactive data map. This map visually represents the process from source to product, 
detailing each step and the associated actors. Users can click on steps or actors for additional information, such as:

- **Details:** Information about the product or process step.
- **Metrics:** Number of consumers, costs, and compliance policies.
- **Costs:** Expenses associated with specific software (e.g., Snowflake Compute, Data Cloud) and maintenance.
- **Classification:** The sub-process's role within the overall pipeline.
- **Input and Output Ports:** Position of the sub-process in the map and related processes.

### Search and Filter Options

The map includes a search function and several filters:

- **Owner Filter:** Filters by areas of responsibility (e.g., "Marketing" or "Controlling").
- **Status Filter:** Filters by active or inactive status.

### Data Product, Source Systems, and Domain Teams Tabs

Several tabs offer different organizational views of the map:

- **Data Product Tab:** Explore products and related sub-processes.
- **Source Systems Tab:** Focus on systems that provide data.
- **Domain Teams Tab:** Lists actors involved, including team descriptions, member roles, and contact options.

### Adding New Sub-Processes

Users can add new sub-processes via the "Add Data Product" tab. This opens a form for inputting information related 
to the new sub-process, ensuring it integrates seamlessly into the map.

## Contract Definition

The demo suggests defining contracts within the data management process. Contracts can be inferred from detailed 
information for each sub-process, including compliance policies, cost breakdowns, and classifications. 
These elements establish agreements between data owners and consumers, ensuring clear expectations and responsibilities.

## Summary

The Data Mesh Manager organizes data in big organizations. It provides an interactive map detailing tasks, 
sub-processes, and actors. Overall, the Data Mesh Manager creates a standardized workspace that facilitates 
collaboration and clarity, ensuring efficient data management and process organization.
